\arguments{
\item{n_loop}{Number of MCMC iterations to perform}

\item{n_warm_up}{Number of warm-up iterations to discard, so that the
number of samples returned is n_loop - n_warm_up}

\item{data}{Numeric vector or matrix of data. If a matrix, the model assumes
it has multiple independent observations of the same random process, one per
column.}

\item{detrend}{Whether to remove a mean and linear trend from the time-series
prior to fitting. If \code{data} is a matrix, this will be done independently for
each column.}

\item{n_segments_min}{Minimum number of segments}

\item{n_segments_max}{Maximum number of segments}

\item{t_min}{Minimum number of observations per segment}

\item{sigma_squared_alpha}{Prior variance of smoothing spline intercept}

\item{tau_prior_a}{Shape of truncated inverse gamma prior for smoothing
spline smoothing parameter}

\item{tau_prior_b}{Scale of truncated inverse gamma prior for smoothing
spline smoothing parameter}

\item{tau_upper_limit}{Upper truncation point for inverse gamma prior for
smoothing spline smoothing parameter}

\item{n_bases}{Number of spline basis vectors to use for log spectrum}

\item{time_step}{Restricts cut points to times divisible by this number}

\item{tuning}{Tuning parameters for the MCMC scheme}

\item{start}{Starting values for MCMC chain. Initialised randomly if blank.
Can be provided an adaptspecfit object in order to continue a previous chain.}

\item{thin}{A list specifying how to thin each output of the MCMC sampler.
A value of 1 indicates no thinning, 2 keeps every second sample, and so on.}

\item{show_progress}{Whether to show a progress indicator during MCMC.}

\item{run_diagnostics}{Whether to run diagnostics afterwards to determine
whether the chain has reached convergence.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{adaptspecfit}. The MCMC samples are available
under the following list entries, each of which are of class
\code{\link[coda]{mcmc}} or \code{\link[acoda]{mcmca}}:
\itemize{
  \item \code{n_segments}: Integer vector with samples of number of segments.
  \item \code{cut_points}: Integer matrix with samples of each cut point, with
  segment 1 cut point in column 1, and so on. Cells to the right of the
  number of segments in that iteration are set to the length of the time
  series.
  \item \code{tau_squared}: Numeric matrix with samples of smoothing spline
  smoothing parameters. Layout is as for `cut_points`.
  \item \code{beta}: Three dimensional array with samples of smoothing spline
  parameters for each segment.
  \item \code{x_missing}: List of numeric matrices, where each matrix holds the
  samples of missing values for each column in `data`
  \item \code{log_posterior}: Numeric vector of unnormalised values of the log
  posterior in each iteration.
}
}
\description{
This function implements a methodology for analyzing possibly non-stationary
time series by adaptively dividing the time series into an unknown but finite
number of segments and estimating the corresponding local spectra by
smoothing splines.

\section{MCMC tuning parameters}{

The \code{tuning} argument allows you to change the tuning parameter of the
reversible-jump MCMC algorithm used to estimate the model. It is a list with
the following entries (and corresponding default values):
\itemize{
  \item \code{prob_short_move} (\code{0.8}): probability of proposing a small
  move of a cutpoint in a within step
  \item \code{short_move_max} (\code{1}): maximum size of small step. When a
  small step is chosen, the proposal is from a discrete uniform with bounds
  \code{[-short_move_max, short_move_max]}
  \item \code{var_inflate} (\code{1}): factor by which to inflate the
  covariance matrix of the spline coefficient proposal
  \item \code{warm_up_var_inflate} (\code{= var_inflate}): as above, but
  applying only during warm-up
  \item \code{use_hmc_within} (\code{TRUE}): whether to also update spline
  parameters using HMC
  \item \code{l_min} (\code{190}): minimum number of leap frog steps to
  take in an HMC iteration. Number of steps is randomly selected from a
  discrete uniform over \code{[l_min, l_max]}
  \item \code{l_max} (\code{210}): maximum number of lead frog steps to
  take in an HMC iteration
  \item \code{epsilon_min} (\code{0.01}): minimum step size in HMC. Step size
  is chosen from a uniform distribution over
  \code{[epsilon_min, epsilon_max]}
  \item \code{epsilon_max} (\code{0.1}): maximum step size in HMC.
}
If a value is omitted or NULL, the default above will be used.
